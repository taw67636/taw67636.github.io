		<p style="color:white">The World Series is Major League Baseball's championship series which pits the National League champion versus the American League champion in a best-of-seven playoff. The 2016 World Series was the 112th edition of the World Series featuring the Chicago Cubs against the Cleveland Indians. The Cubs might not lack fan support, but they were underdogs on paper. The Indians had home field advantage due to the American League winning the 2016 All-star game. The Indians also had an early series lead by three out of the first four games. Chicago turned the tide, however when they managed to win two straight games and survived to game seven. Game seven was all tied up and had to be sent into extra innings. It was looking bleak for Chicago fans, but what seemed like divine intervention there was a rain delay. This allowed the Cubs to collect their composure and ultimately win the game with a final score of 8-7.
